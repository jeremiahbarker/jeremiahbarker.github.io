			<article class="ecotherapy">
				<p>The October 2015 issue of The Atlantic includes an article titled, “The Nature Cure,” wherein James Hamblin discusses the burgeoning implementation and study of ecotherapy within psychiatry. These eco-therapists prescribe solitude in certain parks for a select time or time listening to birdsongs. Ecotherapists do not eschew standard evidence-based treatments, but their ecologically-focused treatments supplement the general approaches for handling mental and emotional ailments. Hamblin cites a recent study published in Neuroscience that reported the soil bacteria Mycibacterium vaccae’s increasing serotonin levels in the brains of mice. If one were to hold moist soil in his hands for approximately 20 minutes, the soil bacteria would begin to disperse its serotonin through the body. The serotonin would likely deconstruct any saturnine thought’s said person was harboring. More researchers are surfacing discussing the positive effects of exposure to nature: as a result of a short jaunt in a park, reduced blood flow to the brain-part that many claim causes brooding; mental restoration from perceiving the susurrus and coolness of moving water; and so on.</p>
 
				<p>From Thoreau to Louv, backwards and forwards, scholars and writers and common folk have recognized the positive results both mental and physical of dwelling in natural environments. Jesus went to the mountains to pray, and his 40-day stint in the wilderness—I envy the stillness he likely experienced—prefaced his active ministry. Parents everywhere demand their children to flee outside, perhaps not simply from necessity. Pilgrimages, the Appalachian Trail, camping trips—these attest to what E. O. Wilson terms the biophilia hypothesis, that humans are genetically predisposed to self-identify with the non-human.</p>

				<p>Reminder: the non-human heals the human.</p>
 
				<p>And from a biblical perspective, I think the Holy Spirit interpentetrates the non-human; that is, through the Holy Spirit, the non-human heals the human. God’s Spirit hovered over the waters, creating and re-creating—and his Spirit continues creating. An acknowledgment of the Holy Spirit’s working within and healing through the oaks and ferns and deer and microorganisms should prompt conservation, discourse concerning climate change (amidst the religious crowd, please), and prayers for the non-human elements of nature. Concatenated, the human and non-human attempt shattering their linking, but may we participate in, pray for, and anticipate the rapprochement of the Edenic, the erasure of the enmity between all natural beings.</p>
